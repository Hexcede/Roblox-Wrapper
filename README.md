All important items for the Roblox-Wrapper are under the Wrapper folder.

## How to install:
  1. Install python 3.5+ if you haven't
  2. Optionally extract to a specific Roblox Player version folder (ignore this if you don't know what that means)
  3. Run `python install.py`
  4. Edit RobloxPlayerBeta.py or RobloxPlayerLauncher.py. These are what launch the real Roblox processes along with their arguments.
  5. You're done! Just hit play on a game and you're good to go!
## How to uninstall:
  1. Run `python uninstall.py`
  2. Optionally run `python cleanup.py` to clear all of the wrapper files. WARNING: this also clears both ahk scripts!
  3. RobloxPlayerBeta.py and RobloxPlayerLauncher.py files will be preserved.
