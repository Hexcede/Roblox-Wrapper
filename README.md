All important items for the Roblox-Wrapper are under the Wrapper folder.

## How to install:
  1. Clone this repository somewhere (it can be anywhere)
  2. Install python 3.5+ if you haven't
  3. Optionally extract to a specific version folder (it only works for RobloxPlayer as of now)
  4. Run `python install.py`
  5. Edit RobloxPlayerBeta.py or RobloxPlayerLauncher.py. These are what launch the real Roblox processes along with their arguments.
  5. You're done! Just hit play on a game and you're good to go!
## How to uninstall:
  1. Run `python uninstall.py`
  2. Optionally run `python cleanup.py` to clear all of the wrapper files. WARNING: this also clears both ahk scripts!
  3. RobloxPlayerBeta.py and RobloxPlayerLauncher.py files will be preserved.
